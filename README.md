# BlockChain ArtKeeper

## Introduction
This is the final submission repository for the CSE 223b final project. We have built an art transaction platform using blockchain technology to prevent fraudulant activities as well as ensure trust and ease of transaction. We combined three separate projects, the backend blockchain code, frontend react code, and the geth private network code into this one repository for the convenience of the viewer.
